## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Graph-owned HITL bridges and resumes from one matching HumanMessage

HITL1 and HITL2 SHALL use public LangGraph interrupts and checkpoint their pending
request before returning. Suspension SHALL project one stable outer `ToolMessage` with
`name=deep_research`, the active tool-call id, and a version-1
`artifact.human_input` request whose source and request id identify the pending research
interrupt. Its title/context SHALL visibly identify `implementation_mode=full_fake`.
Its bounded text fallback SHALL contain the same version-1 control-result
envelope, including opaque research and request ids, that non-suspended actions return.
Resume tool arguments SHALL contain no answer. Resume SHALL select only the
latest eligible post-suspension `HumanMessage` from trusted runtime state, correlate a
structured response to the pending source/request id when present, and supply the
accepted request id, HumanMessage id, exact value, response kind, and optional option id
as one typed `Command(resume=...)` payload. The resumed HITL node SHALL let LangGraph
consume the pending interrupt and SHALL record consumed request/message ids in the same
graph transition; runtime code SHALL NOT patch interrupt tasks or checkpoint fields
outside the graph. Pre-suspension, mismatched, empty,
synthetic-summary, ToolMessage, AIMessage, model-provided argument, and already consumed
responses SHALL NOT advance the graph. After checkpoint inspection, an exact match to
the checkpointed consumed request/message pair SHALL be classified before fresh-answer
correlation and MAY only reproject the current durable pending or terminal result
without requiring the old interrupt to remain pending or invoking another node.

The LangGraph checkpoint interrupt task SHALL be the only pending-request authority;
ResearchState SHALL NOT duplicate a mutable pending descriptor. Request ids SHALL
include a deterministic HITL ordinal derived from prior checkpointed logical HITL
visits, so retrying the same interrupt is stable and a later HITL2 in the same
generation cannot collide. A suspended lifecycle and every fresh resume SHALL require
exactly one pending interrupt descriptor. Multiple descriptors SHALL always fail
closed; zero SHALL be valid only for a typed terminal lifecycle or the locked action
before suspension, and an exact consumed-response delivery retry MAY only reproject
that current durable outcome.

HITL2 SHALL advertise stable option ids and machine values for
`proceed | revise_view | repair | rerun | stop`. Structured option responses SHALL
match both the pending id and value; plain responses SHALL match one advertised value
after bounded normalization. Invalid choice data SHALL be rejected before graph resume
and SHALL leave the same pending interrupt intact.

#### Scenario: Reflected suspension produces the existing UI contract
- **WHEN** the fake graph reaches HITL1 through the reflected async tool
- **THEN** the nested checkpoint contains the pending interrupt before the tool returns a `Command` that adds one stable human-input `ToolMessage`, visibly labels the card `full_fake`, and ends the current lead-agent turn

#### Scenario: Matching card response resumes once
- **WHEN** the newest eligible HumanMessage carries a non-empty `human_input_response` with source `deep_research` and the pending request id
- **THEN** one typed response envelope resumes that interrupt exactly once, LangGraph consumes the pending interrupt, the HITL node records the response request/message ids and completed logical visit in the same transition, and later replay cannot advance another interrupt

#### Scenario: Plain-client response can resume
- **WHEN** a client without structured-card metadata supplies one newer visible non-empty HumanMessage after the suspension cursor
- **THEN** its normalized text is accepted for the one pending request and no earlier message is substituted

#### Scenario: Forged or stale response is denied
- **WHEN** an answer appears only in tool arguments, an AI/ToolMessage, a hidden summary, a pre-suspension HumanMessage, a mismatched request id, or a different outer thread
- **THEN** resume returns `response_mismatch` for an in-scope correlation failure or indistinguishable `research_not_found` for another thread, and leaves the checkpoint and pending interrupt unchanged

#### Scenario: Consumed response reprojects durable outcome
- **WHEN** resume is retried with a HumanMessage already recorded as consumed after the graph reached its next interrupt or terminal checkpoint
- **THEN** the handler reprojects that current suspended or terminal result without invoking a node or accepting the message as another answer

#### Scenario: HITL2 option tampering is denied
- **WHEN** an option response pairs a valid option id with another value, supplies an unknown id/value, or plain text does not match one advertised decision
- **THEN** resume returns `response_invalid` before `Command(resume=...)` and preserves the same HITL2 pending request

### Requirement: Checkpoints and topology contracts remain durable and deterministic

The fake graph SHALL use a versioned research checkpoint namespace isolated from the
outer lead-agent and infra-probe namespaces. ResearchState SHALL contain only bounded
control fields, artifact refs, branch summaries, HITL correlation, consumed-response ids,
and a bounded logical trace, per REG-006 through REG-008; it SHALL NOT contain raw
runtime authority or large research content. File-backed SQLite SHALL recover a
suspended HITL across provider close and a fresh process. Memory and SQLite memory mode
SHALL be labelled same-process only. A committed normalized topology snapshot SHALL
reject unexpected node/edge or reachability changes. Zero-API E2E coverage SHALL include
happy completion, repair, rerun, stop, cancel, stale-response denial, consumed-response
delivery reprojection, and restart resume.

#### Scenario: SQLite restart resumes the same interrupt
- **WHEN** one process starts a lifecycle to HITL, closes the provider, and a fresh process resumes the same trusted user/thread/research id with a matching HumanMessage
- **THEN** the prior pending interrupt and state are recovered, resume continues from that point, and no outer lead-agent or infra-probe checkpoint is read

#### Scenario: Committed suspension survives result-delivery failure
- **WHEN** the nested HITL checkpoint commits and the action fails before the outer ToolMessage is delivered
- **THEN** retrying start from the same trusted scope and start HumanMessage reopens the same namespace and reprojects the same pending request without rerunning completed nodes

#### Scenario: Unknown skeleton schema fails closed
- **WHEN** status, resume, or cancel reads a research checkpoint whose stored `ResearchState.schema_version` is unsupported
- **THEN** it returns `schema_unsupported` before node execution or checkpoint mutation

#### Scenario: Topology drift is detected
- **WHEN** a logical node, edge, route label, or reachability property changes without regenerating the approved semantic snapshot
- **THEN** the topology contract fails with the normalized difference

#### Scenario: Memory does not claim restart durability
- **WHEN** the same-process memory host revisits a lifecycle and a fresh-process capability is inspected
- **THEN** same-process actions work on the retained host but status reports restart recovery unsupported and no restart E2E claim is made

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: One typed ResearchState is the canonical checkpointed control authority

The downstream package SHALL define one versioned typed `ResearchState` in
`domain/state.py` as the sole checkpointed control authority for a research lifecycle,
replacing the change-01 `SkeletonState` and `SkeletonCheckpoint` payload. `ResearchState`
SHALL organize its fields into `identity`, `request`, `control`, `planning`, `work`,
`quality`, and `delivery` blocks. The `identity` block SHALL carry `research_id`,
`outer_thread_id`, `generation`, and `schema_version`, and identity and scope SHALL come
only from the trusted `RuntimeAdapter` envelope and SHALL NOT be overridable by a node,
worker, or model. The `control` block SHALL carry `phase`, `phase_status`, `waiting_for`,
`terminal_status`, `gate_attempts_by_phase`, and `repair_budget_by_phase`; exactly one
legal `phase` and at most one `waiting_for` condition SHALL hold at any time, and
`phase_status`, `waiting_for`, and `terminal_status` SHALL be distinct control fields. The
`work` block SHALL carry `work_specs_by_id`, `work_status_by_id`, and
`accepted_submission_refs`, where `work_status_by_id` is closed to the `WorkStatus` enum
`pending | running | submitted | failed | timed_out | cancelled`. The fake graph SHALL bind
`StateGraph` to the typed
`ResearchState`, the temporary `graph/skeleton_state.py` module SHALL be removed, and the
two schemas SHALL never coexist as authorities. Any future addition to `ResearchState`
SHALL explicitly declare its writer, reader, and reducer.

#### Scenario: Typed state replaces the skeleton payload without changing fake paths
- **WHEN** the fake graph runs start, resume, status, and cancel after the builder binds `ResearchState`
- **THEN** every change-01 fake route, interrupt, terminal marker, and restart-resume path behaves identically, the checkpointed payload is `ResearchState`, and no `graph/skeleton_state.py` symbol is imported

#### Scenario: Identity cannot be overridden by a node or worker
- **WHEN** a node or worker attempts to write `research_id`, `outer_thread_id`, `generation`, or `schema_version`
- **THEN** the reducer rejects the write and the trusted identity derived from `RuntimeAdapter` is preserved

#### Scenario: Only one legal phase and waiting state hold at once
- **WHEN** a reducer receives an update that would set a second active phase or a second `waiting_for` condition
- **THEN** it rejects the update and the prior single legal control state is preserved

#### Scenario: Every field declares its writer, reader, and reducer
- **WHEN** the `ResearchState` field set is inspected
- **THEN** each field has a declared writer, reader, and reducer in the ownership table, and a contract test fails if any field lacks one

### Requirement: State reducers enforce terminal monotonicity, duplicate-hash idempotency, and sole-writer ownership

`ResearchState` SHALL be updated only through declared reducers. A terminal
`work_status` SHALL be monotonic: a later `running` or stale value SHALL NOT downgrade a
terminal status, and at most one terminal winner SHALL hold per work/attempt. The
`generation` field SHALL be monotonic non-decreasing and a reducer SHALL reject any update
that would decrease it. Replaying the same work/attempt with the same content hash SHALL be
idempotent and SHALL NOT append a duplicate or advance phase or generation; replaying the
same work/attempt with a different content hash SHALL be flagged as a conflict and SHALL
NOT be resolved last-write-wins. `accepted_submission_refs` SHALL be dedupe-append only.
`latest_gate_feedback`, `gate_attempts_by_phase`, and `repair_budget_by_phase` SHALL be
writable solely by the gate node; worker, planner, and repair agents SHALL NOT write gate
feedback, gate attempts or repair budgets, `phase`, or `accepted_submission_refs`.

#### Scenario: Terminal status cannot be downgraded
- **WHEN** a reducer receives `running` for a work/attempt whose status is already `submitted`, `failed`, `timed_out`, or `cancelled`
- **THEN** the terminal status is preserved and the late update is rejected

#### Scenario: Same-hash replay is idempotent
- **WHEN** the same work/attempt result with the same content hash is reduced twice
- **THEN** the second reduction performs no append and does not advance phase or generation

#### Scenario: Different-hash replay is a conflict
- **WHEN** the same work/attempt is reduced again with a different content hash
- **THEN** the reducer flags `conflict` rather than overwriting, and the original accepted result is preserved

#### Scenario: Generation cannot decrease
- **WHEN** a reducer receives an update that would lower `generation`
- **THEN** it rejects the update and the current `generation` is preserved

#### Scenario: Workers cannot write gated authority
- **WHEN** a worker or repair agent update attempts to set `latest_gate_feedback`, `gate_attempts_by_phase`, `repair_budget_by_phase`, `phase`, or `accepted_submission_refs`
- **THEN** the reducer rejects the write and only the gate node or controller authority is preserved

### Requirement: Large research content stays out of the checkpoint as bounded content refs

`ResearchState` SHALL NOT store web page bodies, PDFs, full evidence summaries, full
reports, screenshots, or large tool output. Such content SHALL live only as sandbox
artifact files, and `ResearchState` SHALL reference it by at most a sandbox path, a content
hash, a schema version, and a short summary. A hard checkpoint-size bound SHALL reject any
state update whose serialized form exceeds the bound; semantic content SHALL fail
validation rather than be silently truncated. Raw runtime authority —
`TrustedRuntimeEnvelope` fields, AppConfig, model and tool handles, sandbox handles, and
credentials — SHALL NOT enter the checkpoint.

#### Scenario: Oversized content is rejected
- **WHEN** a node returns a state update whose serialized size exceeds the hard checkpoint-size bound
- **THEN** the update is rejected with a typed failure and the checkpoint is not mutated

#### Scenario: Content is referenced, not embedded
- **WHEN** a state update carries large content
- **THEN** the reducer stores only a `ContentRef` (sandbox path, content hash, schema version, short summary) and excludes the raw body from the checkpoint

#### Scenario: Raw runtime authority is rejected
- **WHEN** a state update includes a `TrustedRuntimeEnvelope`, AppConfig, model/tool handle, sandbox handle, or credential field
- **THEN** the reducer rejects the unknown field and the checkpoint is not mutated

### Requirement: Control, evidence, and content authorities remain distinct

The system SHALL keep three authorities distinct: checkpointed `ResearchState` is the
control truth for phase, interrupt, retry, work status, and legal transitions; the
append-only validated submission ledger is the evidence truth for which work output, claim,
or source has been formally accepted; and sandbox artifact files are the content truth for
page cache, evidence, synthesis, and report. The graph checkpoint SHALL be the sole legal
execution path and the system SHALL NOT maintain a second phase-cursor file.
`accepted_submission_refs` in `ResearchState` SHALL hold references into the submission
ledger, not a duplicate of ledger records; the ledger remains the sole evidence authority.
File existence, worker final text, a tool event, or a `running` status SHALL NOT count as a
validated submission. The fake graph SHALL define the `accepted_submission_refs` slot
(referencing the submission ledger) and content-ref slots, with their ownership, but SHALL
NOT implement ledger storage or write real artifacts.

#### Scenario: No second phase cursor exists
- **WHEN** a lifecycle advances phase, suspends, or terminates
- **THEN** the checkpointed `ResearchState` is the only control authority and no companion status file is read or written as a phase cursor

#### Scenario: Only ledger refs count as accepted submissions
- **WHEN** the accepted-submission authority is inspected
- **THEN** only `accepted_submission_refs` (references into the validated ledger) mark accepted submissions, and no field treats file existence, worker final text, a tool event, or a `running` status as accepted coverage

### Requirement: A minimal research bundle layout and path-containment contract scope sandbox writes

The system SHALL define a minimal research bundle rooted at
`workspace/deep-research/<research_id>/` containing `request/`,
`work/<work_id>/<attempt_id>/`, `evidence/`, `synthesis/`, `review/`, `final/`, and
`diagnostics/` subtrees. A worker SHALL write only its own
`<work_id>/<attempt_id>/` directory and controlled cache regions, and writes outside the
assigned research and attempt root SHALL fail closed. Canonical source URLs SHALL be
deduplicated. `diagnostics/gate-attempts.jsonl` SHALL be audit-only and SHALL NOT serve as
a phase cursor. The fake graph SHALL define the layout and containment contract but SHALL
NOT write real bundle artifacts.

#### Scenario: Out-of-containment write is rejected
- **WHEN** the path-containment contract resolves a write path outside the assigned `<work_id>/<attempt_id>/` directory or outside the research root
- **THEN** it rejects the path and no artifact may land outside the contained root

#### Scenario: Diagnostics are not a phase cursor
- **WHEN** `diagnostics/gate-attempts.jsonl` is written
- **THEN** it is used only for audit and the checkpointed `ResearchState` remains the sole phase authority

### Requirement: A versioned ResearchState schema fails closed on incompatible versions

`ResearchState` SHALL carry a `schema_version` field. On read, if the stored
`schema_version` is unsupported or incompatible, the handler SHALL stop and return
`schema_unsupported` before node execution or checkpoint mutation, and SHALL NOT silently
reset, auto-migrate, or reinterpret an incompatible payload. This change SHALL establish
only the version field and the fail-closed contract; business state migration across
versions is explicitly out of scope. The change-01 skeleton schema-version gate SHALL be
preserved in typed form under `ResearchState`.

#### Scenario: Unsupported schema version fails closed
- **WHEN** status, resume, or cancel reads a research checkpoint whose `ResearchState.schema_version` is unsupported
- **THEN** it returns `schema_unsupported` before node execution or checkpoint mutation and does not reset or reinterpret the payload

#### Scenario: No silent migration
- **WHEN** a stored payload carries an incompatible `schema_version`
- **THEN** the handler does not auto-migrate, reinterpret, or silently reset state, and requires an explicit migration path
