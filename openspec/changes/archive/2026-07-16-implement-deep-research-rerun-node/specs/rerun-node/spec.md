## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Rerun scope is parsed from the `hitl2_rerun_payload` checkpoint field

The rerun node SHALL read the `hitl2_rerun_payload` field from checkpoint state. When the field is a dict with a valid `scope` key, the node SHALL extract a typed `RerunScope`. Valid scope values SHALL be `full` (redo all topics from planning), `topic` (redo named topics from source intake), and `finding` (redo specific findings — gap re-search or stale source intake). The scope extraction SHALL be a pure input-parsing step that does not depend on generation having been incremented. If `hitl2_rerun_payload` is `None`, absent, or contains an invalid/missing `scope` key, the node SHALL default to `full` scope. The final `RerunPlan` (assembled after generation increment and route determination) SHALL contain the `RerunScope`, the new generation, the parent generation, and the determined route.

#### Scenario: Full rerun from payload with explicit scope
- **WHEN** `hitl2_rerun_payload` is `{"scope": "full", "reason": "rethink methodology"}`
- **THEN** a `RerunScope` is produced with `scope=FULL`, `target_topic_ids=()`, `retain_topic_ids=()`, and `reason="rethink methodology"`

#### Scenario: Topic-scoped rerun from payload with named targets
- **WHEN** `hitl2_rerun_payload` is `{"scope": "topic", "reason": "weak sources", "target_topic_ids": ["methodology", "market-size"]}` and topic registry contains methodology, market-size, and competitors
- **THEN** a `RerunScope` is produced with `scope=TOPIC`, `target_topic_ids=("methodology", "market-size")`, and `retain_topic_ids=("competitors",)`

#### Scenario: Finding-scoped rerun from payload with named findings
- **WHEN** `hitl2_rerun_payload` is `{"scope": "finding", "reason": "verify claims", "target_finding_ids": ["F-003", "F-007"]}`
- **THEN** a `RerunScope` is produced with `scope=FINDING` and `target_finding_ids=("F-003", "F-007")`

#### Scenario: Missing payload defaults to full rerun
- **WHEN** `hitl2_rerun_payload` is `None` or absent from checkpoint state
- **THEN** the rerun node defaults to `scope=FULL` and writes a diagnostic note to `execution_trace`

#### Scenario: Invalid target IDs in payload default to full rerun
- **WHEN** `hitl2_rerun_payload` specifies `target_topic_ids=["nonexistent"]` but "nonexistent" is not in the topic registry
- **THEN** the rerun node defaults to `scope=FULL` and logs a diagnostic warning

### Requirement: Generation increment is monotonic with old ledger preservation

The rerun node SHALL set `generation = parent_generation + 1` in checkpoint state. The reducer SHALL reject any decrease. The old submission ledger and raw evidence artifacts SHALL remain append-only — no accepted `SubmissionRecord` may be deleted or modified. The `parent_generation` field SHALL record the generation being superseded.

#### Scenario: Generation increments monotonically
- **WHEN** the rerun node runs with `generation = 0`
- **THEN** checkpoint state is updated with `generation = 1` and `parent_generation = 0`

#### Scenario: Generation decrease is rejected by reducer
- **WHEN** a node attempts to set `generation` to a value lower than the current `generation`
- **THEN** the reducer raises `ValueError("generation_decrease")`

#### Scenario: Old ledger entries survive rerun
- **WHEN** the rerun node runs after 5 submissions were accepted in generation 0
- **THEN** `accepted_submission_refs` still contains all 5 refs and no submission is removed

### Requirement: Derived projections are invalidated without raw data loss

The rerun node SHALL invalidate derived projections from the old generation by clearing their checkpoint refs: `synthesis_ref` set to `None`, `decision_brief_ref` set to `None`, `report_refs` set to empty, `repair_counts` set to empty dict. The `hitl2_rerun_payload` SHALL be consumed (set to `None`) to prevent re-reading on checkpoint replay. Raw evidence (submission ledger entries, source caches, accepted claims) SHALL NOT be deleted from the sandbox or checkpoint. The rerun node SHALL NOT delete any sandbox files.

#### Scenario: Synthesis ref is cleared on rerun
- **WHEN** the rerun node runs and `synthesis_ref` is set to a valid ContentRef from generation 0
- **THEN** `synthesis_ref` is set to `None` in the new generation's checkpoint state

#### Scenario: Accepted submission refs survive projection invalidation
- **WHEN** the rerun node runs and `accepted_submission_refs` contains 10 refs
- **THEN** all 10 refs remain in `accepted_submission_refs` after rerun

#### Scenario: HITL2 rerun payload is consumed after reading
- **WHEN** the rerun node reads a valid `hitl2_rerun_payload` and produces a `RerunScope`
- **THEN** `hitl2_rerun_payload` is set to `None` so a checkpoint replay does not re-consume the same payload

#### Scenario: Sandbox files are never deleted by rerun
- **WHEN** the rerun node invalidates derived projections
- **THEN** no sandbox file system operation is performed — invalidation is checkpoint-only

### Requirement: Scoped WorkSpecs are materialized via work-unit kernel

The rerun node SHALL generate new or revised `WorkSpec` entries for topics and findings within the rerun scope through the existing work-unit controller. Topics outside the rerun scope SHALL retain their accepted evidence and SHALL NOT have new WorkSpecs created. The node SHALL write `pending_work_ids` to checkpoint state for fan-out pickup on the next superstep.

#### Scenario: Full rerun delegates WorkSpec creation to topic planner
- **WHEN** scope is `FULL` and the topic registry contains 3 topics
- **THEN** the rerun node creates no WorkSpecs, clears `pending_work_ids`, and routes to `topic_planning` where the topic planner will regenerate the topic registry and create fresh WorkSpecs

#### Scenario: Topic-scoped rerun creates WorkSpecs only for target topics
- **WHEN** scope is `TOPIC` with `target_topic_ids=("A", "C")` and registry has topics A, B, C
- **THEN** 2 WorkSpecs are created for A and C, `pending_work_ids` contains 2 ids, and topic B's accepted submissions remain in `accepted_submission_refs`

#### Scenario: Retained topic evidence is not re-verified
- **WHEN** topic B is in `retain_topic_ids` with 3 accepted submissions
- **THEN** topic B's submissions are preserved and counted toward coverage without new worker execution

### Requirement: Back edges are a closed set determined by rerun scope

The rerun node SHALL route to a closed set of graph edges determined by scope: `full` scope routes to `topic_planning` (re-plan from scratch); `topic` scope routes to `wave0` (scoped source intake, bypassing the topic planner); `finding` scope routes to `wave0` when target findings have stale sources or `wave1` when only deep evidence is affected. When the generation ceiling is reached, the node SHALL route to `exhausted` with `terminal_status=BLOCKED` and `terminal_reason=RERUN_EXHAUSTED`.

#### Scenario: Full scope routes to topic_planning
- **WHEN** scope is `FULL` and generation is below ceiling
- **THEN** the node routes to `topic_planning` with `phase_status=WAITING`

#### Scenario: Topic scope routes to wave0 bypassing topic planner
- **WHEN** scope is `TOPIC` with `target_topic_ids=("methodology",)` and generation is below ceiling
- **THEN** the node routes to `wave0` with scoped WorkSpecs for the target topic only

#### Scenario: Finding scope with stale sources routes to wave0
- **WHEN** scope is `FINDING` and target findings reference wave0-source-age evidence
- **THEN** the node routes to `wave0`

#### Scenario: Finding scope with deep-evidence-only routes to wave1
- **WHEN** scope is `FINDING` and target findings reference only wave1-extracted evidence with valid wave0 backing
- **THEN** the node routes to `wave1`

#### Scenario: Generation ceiling exhaustion blocks rerun
- **WHEN** `generation` equals `max_rerun_generations`
- **THEN** the node routes to `exhausted` with `terminal_status=BLOCKED` and `terminal_reason=RERUN_EXHAUSTED`

### Requirement: New generation must re-pass affected wave gates and HITL2

The rerun node SHALL reset `gate_attempts_by_phase` and `repair_budget_by_phase` for all phases affected by the rerun scope. The old generation's HITL2 `proceed` decision SHALL NOT be inherited. Affected wave gates SHALL re-evaluate from scratch against the new generation's evidence.

#### Scenario: Gate state is reset for affected phases
- **WHEN** scope is `FULL` and generation 0 had gate attempts `{"wave0": 2, "wave1": 3}`
- **THEN** `gate_attempts_by_phase` for affected phases is cleared and gates re-evaluate from attempt 0

#### Scenario: Unaffected phases retain gate state in topic-scoped rerun
- **WHEN** scope is `TOPIC` with `target_topic_ids=("B",)` and generation 0 had gate attempts `{"wave0": 2, "wave1": 1}` for all topics A, B, C
- **THEN** `gate_attempts_by_phase` for phases affecting topic B is reset; phases unrelated to the rerun scope retain their attempts for diagnostic traceability

#### Scenario: Old HITL2 proceed is not inherited
- **WHEN** generation 0 had `hitl2_decision = "proceed"` and the user chooses rerun at HITL2
- **THEN** generation 1 starts with no cached HITL2 decision and must re-suspend at HITL2 for a new user decision

### Requirement: Mixed-graph integration with unchanged topology

Real rerun SHALL require `hitl2=real` (which transitively requires the full chain through wave0, wave1, wave2_synthesis, and targeted_evidence). Selecting `rerun=real` without `hitl2=real` SHALL fail before graph invocation. The full-fake rerun SHALL remain unchanged, preserving the existing `generation <= MAX_FAKE_RERUN_GENERATIONS` ceiling check and the `{"next": "topic_planning", "exhausted": END}` edge set. Topology SHALL be unchanged — only the allowed route values expand to include `wave0` and `wave1`.

#### Scenario: Real rerun requires real hitl2
- **WHEN** a recipe selects `rerun=real` without `hitl2=real`
- **THEN** recipe construction fails with a typed dependency error

#### Scenario: Full-fake rerun remains unchanged
- **WHEN** the full-fake graph reaches the rerun node at generation 1
- **THEN** it bumps generation to 2 and routes `next` → `topic_planning` with no scope, no invalidation, and no WorkSpec creation

#### Scenario: Real rerun back edges coexist with fake-compat edge keys
- **WHEN** the real rerun node routes to `"topic_planning"`, `"wave0"`, or `"wave1"`
- **THEN** the graph topology accepts the route — the conditional edge map includes the new semantic keys alongside the existing `"next"` key (fake backward compat) and `"exhausted"` key, both of which route to the same targets as before
