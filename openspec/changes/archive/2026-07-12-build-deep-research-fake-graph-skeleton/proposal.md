## Why

Change 00 established and archived the trusted runtime substrate, generic `GraphHost`
action registry, isolated checkpoint namespaces, runtime projection, reflected
`deerflow_deep_research.tool:deep_research_tool`, and file-SQLite restart durability.
The repository still has no research topology, lifecycle actions, graph-owned HITL, or
per-phase node packages. Implementing real research behavior before those contracts
exist would make every later node change redefine routing, persistence, and resume
semantics independently.

This change creates the complete Deep Research control-flow skeleton with deterministic
fakes. It proves the graph can start, suspend twice for human input, resume after a
process restart, repair, rerun, stop, cancel, and finish before any LLM, web, or research
filesystem behavior is introduced.

## What Changes

- Add one explicit top-level topology for `bootstrap`, `hitl1`, `topic_planning`,
  `wave0`, `wave1`, `wave2_synthesis`, `targeted_evidence`, `hitl2`, `rerun`,
  `readiness`, and `final_delivery`, with typed routers for pass, repair, rerun, stop,
  and completion edges.
- Add the canonical `graph/nodes/<phase>/` packages and public `NODE_SPEC` surfaces.
  Every package keeps a permanent deterministic fake implementation. Real selection
  fails closed until the later change that owns that node supplies an implementation;
  mixed-mode tests may inject an explicit test implementation without changing the
  topology.
- Add a request-independent graph recipe plus an implementation map. Runtime-scoped
  `GraphContextView` and a runtime-owned reduced dependency resolver are passed through
  non-checkpointed LangGraph invocation context. The resolver creates the correct
  per-node/per-attempt `NodeBuildDependencies` when a node actually runs; no
  `TrustedRuntimeEnvelope`, sandbox handle, host path, AppConfig, or checkpointer
  identity enters graph state.
- Add a minimal, versioned skeleton state containing only lifecycle status, stable
  start-message correlation/digest, phase/generation counters, validated deterministic
  fixture controls, fan-out results, consumed HITL response ids, and a bounded execution
  trace. The pending request itself has one authority: the LangGraph checkpoint's
  interrupt task, not a duplicated state field. Full `ResearchState`, evidence, work-unit,
  submission-ledger, and delivery schemas remain owned by changes 02 and later.
- Add deterministic Wave0/Wave1 `Send` fan-out and reducer-based fan-in fixtures, plus
  repair and rerun loops with explicit bounded counters.
- Add graph-owned HITL1/HITL2 interrupts. A suspended action returns an outer
  `ToolMessage` with the existing `artifact.human_input` version-1 request payload and
  ends the current lead-agent turn. Resume accepts no answer in the tool arguments: it
  reads the latest actual `HumanMessage` from trusted runtime state, requires matching
  `human_input_response.source` and `request_id` metadata when present, binds it to the
  one pending graph interrupt, and rejects stale, cross-thread, or mismatched
  responses. A message already recorded as consumed is classified separately as a
  result-delivery retry and may only reproject the current durable outcome; it never
  advances the graph again. The response value originates from that `HumanMessage`,
  never a model supplied control-tool field.
- Extend the reflected tool and generic host registration with typed `start`, `resume`,
  `status`, and `cancel` handlers while preserving the independent `infra_probe`
  topology and namespace. `start` accepts no caller-selected id or question: after
  ignoring hidden synthetic context, it binds the newest visible genuine
  `HumanMessage` without falling back past an invalid candidate, then derives a collision-resistant opaque
  research id from trusted user/thread scope. Its stable message id is stored as start
  correlation, not as namespace authority. Retrying the same start after a failure
  therefore reopens or reprojects the same lifecycle instead of orphaning a randomly
  named checkpoint; a different start message in that thread conflicts with the one
  existing lifecycle, so change 01 does not introduce multi-active research runs.
  Subsequent actions require the returned id
  but still derive authority from trusted user/thread context. `cancel` is a durable
  terminal transition for a checkpointed research lifecycle; cancellation of an
  actively executing outer tool task continues to use DeerFlow/asyncio cancellation
  from change 00 rather than a second run-control system.
- Treat internal `context.non_interactive` and the fail-closed
  `context.disable_clarification` signal as an unavailable interaction capability. A
  client that can supply the latter can only disable its own HITL path, never enable
  autonomous execution. Until a later change provides an explicit
  checkpointed auto-decision policy, `start` and `resume` fail before mutation in those
  contexts; read-only `status` and durable `cancel` remain available.
- Gate known IM-channel transports separately. The current checked-in channel response
  extractor recognizes clarification only for `ask_clarification`, not a generic
  `deep_research` human-input ToolMessage. Because this change does not modify
  `backend/`, HITL-producing `start`/`resume` fail closed when reduced runtime context
  identifies an IM path through `channel_user_id` and/or `channel_name`; status/cancel
  remain available and a later explicit upstream compatibility change may enable
  generic channel artifacts.
- Require each research lifecycle action to be the sole tool call in the latest outer
  AIMessage. DeerFlow may append built-in/MCP/ACP tools despite configured tool groups;
  if a sibling call exists, the lifecycle returns `exclusive_control_call_required`
  before nested checkpoint mutation. This does not claim to cancel or authorize the
  sibling call itself.
- Define one bounded version-1 research-lifecycle control-result envelope for suspended, completed,
  stopped, cancelled, blocked, unavailable, and denied outcomes. A suspended
  `ToolMessage` carries the same envelope as text fallback plus the human-input
  artifact, so the lead agent can reliably retain the opaque research id and request
  id without parsing UI prose. Every research result is explicitly marked
  `implementation_mode=full_fake`; `infra_probe` keeps its existing independent result
  contract. Fake final delivery emits only a terminal fixture
  marker and never research findings, evidence, citations, or a report.
- Make resume result delivery at-least-once safe as well as start: when the latest
  response message is already recorded as consumed, the handler reprojects the current
  durable next interrupt or terminal result without invoking another node.
- Add deterministic topology snapshots and zero-API E2E paths for happy completion,
  Wave0/Wave1 repair, targeted-evidence convergence, every HITL2 decision
  (`proceed | revise_view | repair | rerun | stop`), readiness/final repair,
  cancellation, stale-resume denial, consumed-response result reprojection,
  idempotent start-result reprojection, and
  file-SQLite process-restart resume. Memory remains explicitly same-process only.
- Update the committed public entry skill and dedicated Agent/SOUL guidance to describe
  the lifecycle as a development skeleton, surface `implementation_mode=full_fake`,
  and forbid presenting its terminal fixture as completed research. Graph logic remains
  outside prompts.

The new requirement IDs are `RUI-006` and `REG-001` through `REG-005`.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `research-graph-lifecycle`: Complete deterministic topology, implementation mapping,
  fake parallelism, graph-owned HITL, typed lifecycle actions, restart recovery,
  topology snapshots, and zero-API E2E behavior.

### Modified Capabilities

- `runtime-integration`: The existing reflected control tool advances from an
  infrastructure-probe-only surface to action-specific research lifecycle dispatch
  while retaining the probe as an isolated diagnostic action.
- `deployment-configuration`: The already committed/materialized public skill and
  per-user Agent/SOUL may describe the new lifecycle, but must label it
  `implementation_mode=full_fake`, keep entry/config paths unchanged, and forbid claims
  of real research output.
- `project-structure`: Preserve the node-package grammar while allowing a
  package-owned optional `subgraph.py` to import public LangGraph `Send`/graph APIs and
  a HITL fake to import exactly public `interrupt`; all other node modules remain
  limited to domain/engine and graph implementation, runtime, agents, and sibling-node
  imports remain forbidden.

## Impact

- **Downstream source:** additive work under
  `agent/src/deerflow_deep_research/{domain,graph,runtime}/`, including topology,
  routing, implementation mapping, lifecycle handlers, minimal skeleton contracts, and
  the eleven canonical node packages. `tool.py` evolves to an action-discriminated
  strict schema and may return a public LangGraph `Command` containing a `ToolMessage`
  for HITL suspension.
- **Tests and governance:** new agent-owned unit, contract, graph, integration, E2E,
  topology snapshot, restart-subprocess, reflected-command viability, and requirement
  traceability coverage. No real LLM or network API is used.
- **Checkpoint data:** one new versioned research namespace and minimal skeleton-state
  schema, including only an opaque start-message reference/digest rather than raw
  runtime authority. The existing infra-probe topology, checkpoint namespace, and
  durability behavior are unchanged.
- **Sandbox data:** runtime projection derives the canonical research root, but fake
  nodes do not call sandbox research tools and write no evidence, cache, ledger, or
  report artifacts. Large business data remains out of checkpoints.
- **Node-agent roles:** none in this change. Every fake is a deterministic graph node;
  the bounded embedded-agent bridge remains unused until a real-node change.
- **DeerFlow extension surfaces:** `config.yaml -> tools[name=deep_research].use` remains
  `deerflow_deep_research.tool:deep_research_tool`; the existing
  `tool_groups[name=deep-research-control]`,
  `extensions_config.json -> skills.deep-research-controller.enabled`,
  `skills/public/deep-research-controller/SKILL.md`, and per-user
  `{DEER_FLOW_HOME}/users/{user_id}/agents/deep-research/{config.yaml,SOUL.md}` remain
  the only entry surfaces. MCP, ACP, DeerFlow `task` subagents, phase skills, and DPT
  bundle control files are not used.
- **Reload boundary:** public skill, Agent/SOUL, and reflected tool description changes
  take effect on the next agent build. Python package code requires the normal Gateway
  restart/source reload already established by change 00. No `config.yaml` startup-only
  field, mount, database/checkpointer, sandbox, worker-count, or launcher behavior is
  changed, so this change introduces no new `reload_boundary.STARTUP_ONLY_FIELDS`
  impact.
- **Non-goals:** no real research node, model call, web access, evidence/work-unit/
  submission ledger, report artifact, progress UI optimization, launcher, Docker live
  smoke, Postgres profile, multi-worker coordination, or modification under `backend/`
  or `frontend/`. Any upstream change is a separate BREAKING escalation.
